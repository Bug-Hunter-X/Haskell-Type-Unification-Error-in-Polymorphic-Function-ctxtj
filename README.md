This repository demonstrates a common Haskell error related to type unification in polymorphic functions. The `bug.hs` file contains code that triggers a type error. The `bugSolution.hs` demonstrates how to fix the issue by either correctly typing the function or providing more explicit type annotations where needed. This is a useful example for illustrating common beginner mistakes in Haskell's type system.
