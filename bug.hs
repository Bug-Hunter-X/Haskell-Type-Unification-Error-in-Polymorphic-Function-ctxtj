This Haskell code attempts to use a polymorphic function `mystery` with a type that doesn't unify:

```haskell
mystery :: a -> b -> a
mystery x y = x

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = mystery 5 "hello"
  print result
```

The compiler will complain because `a` must be both an `Int` (from `5`) and a `String` (from `"hello"`), which is impossible.  This often arises from incorrect type signatures or a misunderstanding of type constraints.
