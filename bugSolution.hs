Several solutions exist, depending on the intention:

**1. Correct Type Signature:** If the function should always return the first argument, regardless of type, the type signature is already correct, and the problem lies in the *usage* of the function (see below).

**2. More Specific Type Signature:** If the function needs to handle different types differently, create separate functions with explicit types:

```haskell
mysteryInt :: Int -> b -> Int
mysteryInt x y = x

mysteryString :: String -> b -> String
mysteryString x y = x

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let resultInt = mysteryInt 5 "hello" -- Fine now
  let resultString = mysteryString "hello" 5 --Fine now
  print resultInt
  print resultString
```

**3. Addressing Usage Error:** If the intention was to correctly use `mystery` with compatible types, ensure that the arguments provided are of the same type:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = mystery 5 5 -- Correct usage
  print result

  let result2 = mystery "hello" "world" -- Correct usage
  print result2
```
The key is understanding Haskell's type system and ensuring that types correctly unify during function calls.
